# Primal Movement Fundamentals – Beyond the Basics

Primal movement isn't just another fitness trend—it's a return to the patterns that made us human. These fundamental movements are encoded in our DNA, refined through millions of years of evolution. But in our modern, sedentary world, we've forgotten how to move.

## The Seven Primal Patterns

Every complex movement we perform is built upon these foundational patterns:

### 1. **Squat**
The foundation of all lower body strength. Not just a gym exercise, but a fundamental human position for rest, work, and survival.

### 2. **Hinge**
The power generator. From picking up children to lifting heavy objects, the hip hinge is essential for protecting your back and generating force.

### 3. **Lunge**
Unilateral stability and mobility. Walking, running, climbing—all require the ability to move one leg independently while maintaining balance.

### 4. **Push**
Upper body pressing strength. From opening doors to pushing yourself up from the ground, pushing patterns are essential for daily function.

### 5. **Pull**
Upper body pulling strength. Climbing, carrying, and maintaining posture all depend on strong pulling patterns.

### 6. **Rotate**
Core stability and power transfer. Every athletic movement, from throwing to striking, requires effective rotation.

### 7. **Gait**
The integration of all patterns. Walking and running are the ultimate expressions of primal movement mastery.

## Why These Patterns Matter

Modern fitness often focuses on isolated muscle groups, but life doesn't happen in isolation. When you need to lift a heavy object, you don't just use your biceps—you use your entire body in coordinated movement.

Primal patterns teach you to:

- **Move efficiently** - Using the right muscles at the right time
- **Prevent injury** - Maintaining proper alignment under load
- **Build functional strength** - Strength that serves you in real-world situations
- **Improve mobility** - Moving through full ranges of motion

## The Built Primal Approach

We don't just teach these patterns—we integrate them into a comprehensive training system:

### **Assessment First**
Before prescribing movement, we assess your current capabilities. Where are you strong? Where are you limited? What compensations have you developed?

### **Progressive Mastery**
We start with the basics and progressively add complexity. Master the pattern before adding load, speed, or complexity.

### **Integration Training**
Once individual patterns are mastered, we combine them into complex movements that mimic real-world demands.

## Practical Application

Start with these three foundational movements:

1. **Bodyweight Squat** - 3 sets of 10, focusing on depth and form
2. **Hip Hinge** - 3 sets of 10, maintaining neutral spine
3. **Plank Hold** - 3 sets of 30 seconds, building core stability

Focus on quality over quantity. Each rep should be perfect before you add weight or complexity.

## Beyond the Gym

The real test of primal movement mastery isn't in the gym—it's in life. Can you:

- Pick up a child without hurting your back?
- Carry groceries without losing your balance?
- Get up from the ground gracefully?
- Move quickly when needed?

These are the skills that matter. These are the skills that primal movement develops.

## The Journey Forward

Primal movement isn't a destination—it's a journey. It's about rediscovering your body's natural capabilities and developing them to their fullest potential.

Start with the fundamentals. Master the basics. Then watch as your movement quality, strength, and confidence transform not just your workouts, but your entire life.
