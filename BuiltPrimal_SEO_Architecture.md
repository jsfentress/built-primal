# BuiltPrimal.com – SEO Site Architecture & Topical Cluster Strategy

## 1. Top-Level Pillars (four permanent folders)

| Pillar | Folder | Core Purpose |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Move Primal** | `/move/` | Teach fundamental movement patterns and strength progressions that mimic evolutionary human activity. |
| **Flow State** | `/flow/` | Guide users toward continuous, skill-based movement sequences that build coordination and joint control. |
| **Breath Mastery** | `/breath/` | Provide evidence-backed breath training and breath-holding protocols with a safety-first approach. |
| **Primal Lifestyle** | `/lifestyle/` | Cover recovery, nutrition, sleep, mindset, and habit design so training gains become sustainable. |

## 2. Cluster Map inside each Pillar

### `/move/` Clusters
- **Movement Patterns**: crawl, squat, hinge, lunge, rotate, gait
- **Skill Progressions**: beginner, intermediate, advanced, load variations
- **Equipment Guides**: clubs, maces, kettlebells, sandbags
- **Program Templates**: 30-day primal strength, micro-dosed mobility
- **Science & Benefits**: fascia adaptation, bone density research

### `/flow/` Clusters
- **Flow Fundamentals**: what is flow, flow state neuroscience
- **Modalities**: animal flow, capoeira basics, locomotion games
- **Routine Builder**: create a ten-minute daily flow, sequencing rules
- **Plateau Fixes**: troubleshooting stiffness, motor control drills
- **Case Studies**: athlete spotlights, rehab success stories

### `/breath/` Clusters
- **Physiology & Safety**: mammalian dive reflex, blackout prevention
- **Training Tables**: CO₂ tables, O₂ tables, incremental plans
- **Techniques Library**: box breathing, apnea walks, pranayama, Wim Hof method
- **Sport Applications**: freediving, big-wave surfing, endurance racing
- **Gear Reviews**: pulse oximeters, freedive watches, breathing apps

### `/lifestyle/` Clusters
- **Nutrition & Fuel**: ancestral diet primers, macro cycling, hydration science
- **Recovery Protocols**: mobility flows, cold exposure, sleep optimization
- **Mindset & Habit**: deliberate practice, flow journaling, motivation traps
- **Community & Challenges**: 30-day primal reset, breath-hold leaderboard

## 3. Cross-Pillar Integration Area: `/programs/`

- **Beginner Primal Blueprint**: four-week plan combining basic movement, easy flow, and box breathing.
- **Athlete Flow Intensive**: six-week capoeira-inspired flow plus advanced CO₂ tolerance.
- **Longevity Stack**: daily micro-workouts, mobility snacks, breath-centric recovery, nutrition tracker.

## 4. URL Conventions

- Keep slugs short and descriptive (e.g., `/move/crawl-pattern-guide/`)
- Place every article inside exactly one pillar folder for clean silos.
- Use breadcrumbs and schema (`ItemList`, `HowTo`, `FAQ`) so search engines decode hierarchy.

---

## 5. Internal-Link Blueprint

1. Each pillar hub links down to every cluster page.
2. Every cluster page links sideways to sibling clusters and up to its hub.
3. Supporting assets link back to their immediate cluster page and also upward to the hub.
4. Cross-pillar pieces in `/programs/` link to at least one article in each contributing pillar.

## 6. Content Prioritization Schedule

| Quarter | Focus | Key Metrics |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q1 | Publish four pillar hubs and one flagship article per cluster. | Indexed pages, impressions per pillar. |
| Q2 | Release two supporting assets per cluster and launch first program page. | Organic clicks, lead magnet sign-ups. |
| Q3 | Add expert videos and interactive tools (breath-hold timer, flow routine generator). | Average session length, backlinks earned. |
| Q4 | Run content-decay audit, refresh stats, and expand clusters that lag behind. | Top-three keyword share, conversion rate to programs. |

## 7. E-E-A-T Enhancers

- **Credentials**: display certifications for movement and freediving professionals.
- **Research citations**: link to peer-reviewed studies on respiratory physiology and biomechanics.
- **First-party data**: share HRV or CO₂ tolerance results from community challenges.
- **Transparency**: maintain author pages with real-name bios, social proofs, and contact pathways.

---

### Why this is an upgrade

- **Semantic breadth**: four distinct but interlocking pillars cover every entity Google associates with primal training, flow, and breath.
- **User journey alignment**: pillars mirror the sequence most visitors follow, from movement literacy to integrated lifestyle.
- **Clean silos**: single-folder rule avoids the diluted topical relevance that comes from mixing subjects in one directory.
- **Cross-pillar programs**: bundled roadmaps satisfy “course,” “challenge,” and “program” intents without fragmenting authority.
